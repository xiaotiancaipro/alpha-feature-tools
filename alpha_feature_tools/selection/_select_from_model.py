from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel as SKL_SelectFromModel


class SelectFromModel(SKL_SelectFromModel):
    """Meta-transformer for selecting features based on importance weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        The base estimator from which the transformer is built.
        This can be both a fitted (if ``prefit`` is set to True)
        or a non-fitted estimator. The estimator should have a
        ``feature_importances_`` or ``coef_`` attribute after fitting.
        Otherwise, the ``importance_getter`` parameter should be used.

    threshold : str or float, default=None
        The threshold value to use for feature selection. Features whose
        absolute importance value is greater or equal are kept while the others
        are discarded. If "median" (resp. "mean"), then the ``threshold`` value
        is the median (resp. the mean) of the feature importances. A scaling
        factor (e.g., "1.25*mean") may also be used. If None and if the
        estimator has a parameter penalty set to l1, either explicitly
        or implicitly (e.g, Lasso), the threshold used is 1e-5.
        Otherwise, "mean" is used by default.

    prefit : bool, default=False
        Whether a prefit model is expected to be passed into the constructor
        directly or not.
        If `True`, `estimator` must be a fitted estimator.
        If `False`, `estimator` is fitted and updated by calling
        `fit` and `partial_fit`, respectively.

    norm_order : non-zero int, inf, -inf, default=1
        Order of the norm used to filter the vectors of coefficients below
        ``threshold`` in the case where the ``coef_`` attribute of the
        estimator is of dimension 2.

    max_features : int, callable, default=None
        The maximum number of features to select.

        - If an integer, then it specifies the maximum number of features to
          allow.
        - If a callable, then it specifies how to calculate the maximum number of
          features allowed by using the output of `max_feaures(X)`.
        - If `None`, then all features are kept.

        To only select based on ``max_features``, set ``threshold=-np.inf``.

    importance_getter : str or callable, default='auto'
        If 'auto', uses the feature importance either through a ``coef_``
        attribute or ``feature_importances_`` attribute of estimator.

        Also accepts a string that specifies an attribute name/path
        for extracting feature importance (implemented with `attrgetter`).
        For example, give `regressor_.coef_` in case of
        :class:`~sklearn.compose.TransformedTargetRegressor`  or
        `named_steps.clf.feature_importances_` in case of
        :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` with its last step named `clf`.

        If `callable`, overrides the default feature importance getter.
        The callable is passed with the fitted estimator and it should
        return importance for each feature.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from alpha_feature_tools.selection import SelectFromModel
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    >>> X = [[ 0.87, -1.34,  0.31 ],
    ...      [-2.79, -0.02, -0.85 ],
    ...      [-1.34, -0.48, -2.55 ],
    ...      [ 1.92,  1.48,  0.65 ]]
    >>> y = [0, 1, 0, 1]
    >>> selector = SelectFromModel(estimator=LogisticRegression()).fit(X, y)
    >>> selector.estimator_.coef_
    array([[-0.3252302 ,  0.83462377,  0.49750423]])
    >>> selector.threshold_
    0.55245...
    >>> selector.get_support()
    array([False,  True, False])
    >>> selector.transform(X)
    array([[-1.34],
           [-0.02],
           [-0.48],
           [ 1.48]])

    Using a callable to create a selector that can use no more than half
    of the input features.

    >>> def half_callable(X):
    ...     return round(len(X[0]) / 2)
    >>> half_selector = SelectFromModel(estimator=LogisticRegression(),
    ...                                 max_features=half_callable)
    >>> _ = half_selector.fit(X, y)
    >>> half_selector.max_features_
    2
